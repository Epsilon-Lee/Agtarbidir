# Agtarbidir
This toolkit implements an neural sequence converter, which converts an input sequence to an output sequence.
It is mainly developed by Lemao Liu @ NICT Japan, following the paper: Agreement on Target-bidirectional LSTMs for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning.

# It will be available soon
The entire code will be available once we obtain the permission from our employer NICT.
